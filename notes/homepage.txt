When sending a new email, there is an opportunity to build a new customer object. A flag could be there to determine if they are a guest, returning customer, or registered user. There is also the opportunity to build an archive of emails. An email object can have a customer and email associated with it. An email contains one user, and users can potentially have a collection of emails assoicaited with them.

The email controller would be responsible for:
  -retrieving a new customer object
  -determining if the user is already in the DB,
    if so, don't create a new user
    if not, create a new user
  -saving email to DB
  -emailing kevin
